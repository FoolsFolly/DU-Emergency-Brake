# DU-Emergency-Brake

This will hit your brakes and level your aircraft before you hit the ground, if you are falling at unsafe speeds.
Note that this will not protect you from slamming into the side of a mountain. Nor will it save a heavy vehicle with inadequate airbrakes. Use at your own discretion.
